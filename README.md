# pcb-electromagnets
This project aims to produce small bore electromagnets using printed circuit boards instead of traditional wire coils or stacked plates. 

Topologies which will be tested first:
- Bitter Electromagnet (Mostly seeking to characterise the effects of current on field strength, before it catches fire)
- Stacked PCBs forming a solenoid with a ferrite core
- Helmholtz Coil and Maxwell Coil

Why PCBs? Why not use copper wire?
- Lower production cost
- Multiple turns of the electromagnet can be made on a single PCB and interconnected to reduce the total number of PCBs required, at the cost of thermal performance
- Small electromagnets can be extremely difficult to build without pre-fabricated parts with known tolerances, which can be readily made with standard PCBs by any PCB manufacturer.
- Ability to test dozens of coil topologies for extremely cheap by using panelised PCBs

This is currently just a prototype I am working on. I aim to test not only styles of electromagnets, but to test the feasibility of using PCB-based electromagnets in small bore, moderate field applications like benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
